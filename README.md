# Mobile_Robot_Simulation_in_Dynamic_Environment


## ðŸ”¹ Abstract
Mobile robots play an important role in modern applications such as warehouses, service robotics, and autonomous vehicles, where they must operate in **dynamic environments** that include both **static and moving obstacles**. Traditional navigation approaches often rely on expensive sensors like LiDAR or require complex SLAM algorithms for mapping and localization.  

This project presents a **cost-effective alternative**, where a mobile robot is simulated in **ROS and Webots** using only **low-cost sensors**:  
- **Wheel encoders** for odometry (distance and velocity estimation).  
- **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** for orientation and drift correction.  
- **Ultrasonic sensors** for real-time obstacle detection.  

The robot does not construct a global map (no SLAM); instead, it combines **dead-reckoning (encoders + IMU)** with **reactive obstacle avoidance** using ultrasonic sensors. A **path planning algorithm** (e.g., D* or A*) provides a global route to the target, while a **local planner** dynamically adjusts the trajectory to avoid collisions with moving obstacles. Control is achieved through a **PID-based motion controller**, ensuring smooth navigation.  

Simulation results show that the robot can:  
- Successfully follow a planned path toward a target.  
- React in real time to avoid dynamic obstacles.  
- Improve localization accuracy through encoder + IMU fusion compared to encoders alone.  

This work demonstrates that even without LiDAR or SLAM, a mobile robot can navigate effectively in dynamic environments using lightweight sensor fusion and control techniques. It highlights a **low-cost and practical approach** that could be applied to small-scale robots or educational robotics platforms.  


## ðŸ”¹ About
This project demonstrates how a mobile robot can navigate in a **dynamic environment** using **ROS** and **Webots**, relying on low-cost sensors:  
- **Encoders** for odometry (distance + velocity estimation).  
- **IMU** for orientation and stability.  
- **Ultrasonic sensors** for detecting nearby obstacles.  

Instead of building a global map (no SLAM), the robot uses **dead-reckoning + obstacle detection** to follow a path and dynamically avoid collisions.
